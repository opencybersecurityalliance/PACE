# 1 Introduction

<!-- All text is normative unless otherwise labeled -->


Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named Pace-v1.0.0-psd01.md), if needed:

pandoc -f gfm -t html Pace-v1.0.0-psd01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3a.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o Pace-v1.0.0-psd01.html --metadata title="PACE Specification Version 1.0.0"

NOTES:
- The two .css files included in the "styles" directory are also online:
  - https://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/css/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css
  - https://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/css/markdown-styles-v1.7.3a.css (this one produces HTML that resembles the github display more closely, especially for blocks of code)
  - If you want to use one of the included .css files in pandoc, or develop a different .css file, simply link to it (using -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3a.css) instead of the online files.

OASIS staff are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.
A TC may use other ways to generate HTML from markdown, and may generate a TOC in a different way.

Below: Sections 1.1 and 1.2 are expected to be a part of OASIS specifications. Sections 1.3 and 1.4 are examples in Markdown.

## 1.1 Changes from earlier Versions

This section provides a description of significant differences from previously published, differently numbered Versions of this specification, if any. (Detailed revision history of this numbered Version should be tracked in an Appendix.)

## 1.2 Glossary

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms

### 1.2.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

### 1.2.3 Document conventions

- Naming conventions
- Font colors and styles
- Typographic conventions

## 1.3 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when the HTML is generated.
Even if the text appears to be separate lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters (or space-backslash) to the end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph tag \
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.3.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE:
<note caption is best placed ABOVE figure, so a hyperlink to it will actually display the figure, instead of rendering the figure off the screen above the caption. The same placement should be used for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this image is missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.3.2 Tables

#### 1.3.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.3.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.3.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption:
Please see [Table 1-5 or other meaningful label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction)


### 1.3.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

Left-justified list without bullets or numbers:
To list multiple items without full paragraph breaks between items, add space-backslash after each item except the last.

### 1.3.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6 headings like: `###### [RFC2119]`
###### [RFC2119]
Bradner, S., "Key words ..."

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like: `see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]`  
"see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:  
  - punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )  
  - leading white spaces will be dropped  
  - upper case will be converted to lower  
  - spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to cross-references and to section headings.  
  - Thus, a section heading like "## 1.2 Glossary"  
  - becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#12-glossary">`  
  - referenced in the markdown like: see [Section 1.2](#12-glossary)  
  - in markdown: `"see [Section 1.2](#12-glossary)"`  
  - similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.3.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code block).

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML format. If it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single "backtick" character:
`code text`

## 1.4 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the PDF - in particular, before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" - which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)

-------

# 2 Section Heading
text.

## 2.1 Level 2 Heading
text.

### 2.1.1 Level 3 Heading
text.

#### 2.1.1.1 Level 4 Heading
text.

##### 2.1.1.1.1 Level 5 Heading
`This is the deepest level, because six # gets transformed into a Reference tag.`


## 2.2 Next Heading
text.

-------

# 3 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the OP for public review, or for publication at the Project Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.

For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":

# Appendix B. Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Open Projects consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists “eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle” as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and OP members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.
